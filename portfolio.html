  <p>In this project, my group and I designed a flower with bugs interacting with it. First we made painter draw the flower and create the background. For the background we created grass and a sky with clouds. Then we created three bugs that have different colors and made the bugs climed up the flower. When each bug climbs up the flower it will change the color of the outer petals to the exact same color as the bug. After the bug changes the color the bug leaves and then another bug comes. The process then repeats until all the bugs pass. </p>
